                  The IT industry has a major problem right now. There are a lot of companies shifting into AI right now and there are not enough qualified
                  people for this giant technological shift.

                  <p>
                  According to recent studies by McKinsey & Company, there will be around
                  12 million new jobs or requirements in this space by 2030. Around 30 percent of all hours worked WILL be automated with the help of
                  Generative AI and Low Code Tooling.

                  We are in the middle of a technological shift that we have not seen the likes of since the advent of the internet. The quicker you can take advantage of this, the better. In fact most of the top
                  people in this field have no formal eduvation in AI.

                The main reason that me and my team have created this program is to teach as many people as we can to not make the same mistakes that we did. I wish I had this resource when I was first learning
                and working in the industry. It could have saved me so much time and so many headaches
